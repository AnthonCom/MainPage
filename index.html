            <p>Hello! As you saw, my name is Anthony. I've had a keen interest in computing and IT spanning all the way back to my childhood, using the family computer to edit .shp files for the original Homeworld (1999). Sadly I had limited ability to develop this interest further until my early 20s, when I could finally afford to build a system with my own choice of hardware. I've now built multiple systems for myself over the years, as well as building systems for family and friends. These range from office builds running early AMD Ryzen series CPUs with the most basic components, up to my current personal device that may be falling victim to Intel's 13th & 14th gen CPU fumble.</p>
            <p>I found myself with an opportunity at the start of the year to further expand my knowledge to include software skills as well as hardware. I have, in the past, attempted programming projects, though these were simple modifications for games rather than creating from scratch. Undertaking a "skills bootcamp", I've learned the fundamentals for HTML & CSS, Javascript, SQL and Python development. These skills have allowed me to create a number of personal projects.</p>
            <p>What can I offer you as a potential employee? More than you might think. My development knowledge is Junior level at best right now, but I can bring a wealth of experience from outside the Development sector that most Junior Developers won't have. I've worked in multiple business sectors over the years, and picked up a wide range of compatible skills. Imagine a new hire with more than 10 years of customer service experience, knowledge of GDPR intricacies, tech-based Operations and management experience, AND is willing to build up their development skills from scratch with the aid of bug fixing and testing experience learned through messing around in the file structures of heavily modded videogames.</p>
            <p>To any prospective recruiters, please be aware that I am diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and anxiety. Special accommodations may be required because of these disabilities. My communications preferences are via text (e-mail primarily), I would prefer initial contact in this format to allow me to process information and prepare a response at my own pace.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately the game is not playable on mobile devices. It uses keyboard controls, which are outlined on the page itself.

                    <p>Part of the SQL section of the Skills Bootcamp, I was tasked with creating a database for any scenario I could think of. I opted to go back in time to the age of Video Rentals by creating a SQL database intended for use within a store such as BlockBuster. SQL isn't the most visually appealing language, so I have heavily commented code to make it easier to understand.</p>
                    <p>The project is coded entirely in SQL. Code is viewable in plaintext on GitHub, but to actually run it you will need MySQL Workbench 8.0</p>

This links to a GitHub repository for the finished project, but in order to actually run this you will need to download all the relevant files and open them with a copy of Visual Studio Code with the relevant Python extensions installed.</p>
                    <p>You can also simply look at the code in plaintext on github, just pretend not to see the answers when reading the questions.</p>

                <p>Hello! As you saw, my name is Anthony. I've had a keen interest in computing and IT spanning all the way back to my childhood, using the family computer to edit .shp files for the original Homeworld (1999). Sadly I had limited ability to develop this interest further until my early 20s, when I could finally afford to build a system with my own choice of hardware. I've now built multiple systems for myself over the years, as well as building systems for family and friends. These range from office builds running early AMD Ryzen series CPUs with the most basic components, up to my current personal device that may be falling victim to Intel's 13th & 14th gen CPU fumble.</p>
                <p>I found myself with an opportunity at the start of the year to further expand my knowledge to include software skills as well as hardware. I have, in the past, attempted programming projects, though these were simple modifications for games rather than creating from scratch. Undertaking a "skills bootcamp", I've learned the fundamentals for HTML & CSS, Javascript, SQL and Python development. These skills have allowed me to create a number of personal projects.</p>
                <p>What can I offer you as a potential employee? More than you might think. My development knowledge is Junior level at best right now, but I can bring a wealth of experience from outside the Development sector that most Junior Developers won't have. I've worked in multiple business sectors over the years, and picked up a wide range of compatible skills. Imagine a new hire with more than 10 years of customer service experience, knowledge of GDPR intricacies, tech-based Operations and management experience, AND is willing to build up their development skills from scratch with the aid of bug fixing and testing experience learned through messing around in the file structures of heavily modded videogames.</p>
                <p>To any prospective recruiters, please be aware that I am diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and anxiety. Special accommodations may be required because of these disabilities. My communications preferences are via text (e-mail primarily), I would prefer initial contact in this format to allow me to process information and prepare a response at my own pace.</p>

                <div class="sidel1"><h3>Torpedo Defender</h3>
                    <p>An experiment with Javascript, attempting to create a version of the classic "Space Invaders", with tweaks to game design. It also doubles as a brief look into my interests. This has been coded in JS on top of HTML, with CSS styling using assets created by myself.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately the game is not playable on mobile devices. It uses keyboard controls, which are outlined on the page itself. Because your window size is registering as a mobile device, the image link will redirect you to the GitHub project rather than a live version of the project. If you wish to view a live version of the page anyway, please click <a href="https://anthoncom.github.io/JSProj/">here.</a></p>

                    <p>Part of the SQL section of the Skills Bootcamp, I was tasked with creating a database for any scenario I could think of. I opted to go back in time to the age of Video Rentals by creating a SQL database intended for use within a store such as BlockBuster. SQL isn't the most visually appealing language, so I have heavily commented code to make it easier to understand.
                    <p>The project is coded entirely in SQL. Code is viewable in plaintext on GitHub, but to actually run it you will need MySQL Workbench 8.0</p>

                    <p>A quiz program created within Python to serve as a knowledge demonstrator, but also provide some knowledge of my interests and hobbies. This links to a GitHub repository for the finished project, but in order to actually run this you will need to download all the relevant files and open them with a copy of Visual Studio Code with the relevant Python extensions installed.</p>
                    <p>You can also simply look at the code in plaintext on github, just pretend not to see the answers when reading the questions.</p>

                            You can reach out to me via e-mail using the link to the right. Alternatively feel free to send me a message through LinkedIn. I primarily prefer to be contacted through text where possible as my autism can cause me to miss some social cues and fumble words. E-mails or direct messages allow me enough time to read through and think about a response without needing to rush.
